# Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis: Prosper Loan Dataset
## by Joseph Etim


## Dataset

> The Prosper Loan data contains 113, 937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower's rate, current loan status, borrower's income and many others. This dataset can be downloaded on [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQmkX4iOT6Rcrin42vslquX2_wQCjIa_hbwD0xmxrERPSOJYDtpNc_3wwK_p9_KpOsfA6QVyEHdxxq7/pub) and the data dictionary is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0). 


## Summary of Findings
> In the exploration, I found out that most of the borrowers are on 36 months payment period, and as at the time the data was gathered, many of them are still paying while few of them had their loan request cancelled. Larger percentage of these borrowers are employed and the common reason stated for taking loan was to service debt and 2013 witnessed the highest turnout. The average amount borrowed was around 8200 at an average rate of 0.19 and monthly payment of around 275. Also, some of these borrowers prefer not to indicate their profession and hence hide under 'others' and 'professional'. The known professions with highest number of borrowers are computer programmers, teachers and analysts.

>  I also found out that the only variable that has strong correlation with the Borrower rate is Borrower APR. It was actually surprising to see that BorrowerRate has a negative correlation with LoanOriginalAmount, and weak correlation with Loan Term. There are no strong relationships between most of the variables. However, LoanOriginalAmount and MonthlyLoanPayment has a strong correlation between them. Lastly, there's a positive correlation between amount of loan and payment term.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the impact of other variables on borrower's rate and leave out most of the other findings.
